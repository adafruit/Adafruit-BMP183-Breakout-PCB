Fans of the BMP085/BMP180 will want to take a look at the new BMP183 - an SPI spin on the old familiar classic. This precision sensor from Bosch is the best low-cost sensing solution for measuring barometric pressure and temperature. Because pressure changes with altitude you can also use it as an altimeter!
